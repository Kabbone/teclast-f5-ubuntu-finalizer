# Battery Extension Design
In order to solder another battery into your Teclast F5, you might as well make your own battery extension case.

# Use OpenScad to take a look at the files.
# Send the STL Shapeways to make the 3-D printer battery extension.

Solder instructions to be added at a later date.
